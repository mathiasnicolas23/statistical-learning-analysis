A comprehensive repository showcasing statistical analysis and probabilistic modeling techniques applied to real-world datasets.
# Statistical Learning & Data Analysis

## Key Components
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* **File:** `exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`
* **Focus:** Rigorous data cleaning, outlier detection, and hypothesis testing to extract insights from raw data manually collected for physic modeling.

### 2. Probabilistic Modeling (Naive Bayes)
* **File:** `probabilistic_modeling_bayes.ipynb`
* **Focus:** Implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier. This demonstrates a core understanding of conditional probability and Bayes' Theorem, the mathematical backbone of generative AI models.
